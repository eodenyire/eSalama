## Digital Student Safety & Smart Attendance System

---

## 1. Background & Rationale

Schools today face growing concerns around **student safety, attendance accuracy, and parental assurance**, especially for learners who commute daily from home to school. Parents want confidence that their children arrive safely. Teachers need accurate, real-time attendance data. School administrators require reliable systems for monitoring, reporting, and compliance.

Current attendance systems are largely **manual, delayed, and reactive**, offering little visibility into a student’s journey to and from school. In the event of delays, route deviations, or emergencies, schools and parents often receive information too late to respond effectively.

**eSalama Schools** is designed to address this gap by providing a **secure, real-time, and integrated digital platform** that ensures student safety, automates attendance, and enhances communication between parents, teachers, and school administrators.

## 2. Overview of eSalama Schools

**eSalama Schools** is a digital student safety and attendance platform that leverages **GPS tracking, QR code verification, real-time notifications, and centralized reporting** to monitor and confirm student movements from home to school and back.

The system consists of four interconnected applications and a centralized backend administration portal:

* Student Application
* Parent Application
* Class Teacher Application
* School Gate QR Scanner Application
* Backend Administration & Reporting Portal

Together, these components provide **end-to-end visibility** of a learner’s daily school journey while prioritizing **privacy, consent, and child protection**.
